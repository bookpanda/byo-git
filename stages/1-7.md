# 4. Read a tree object
- `git ls-tree <tree-sha>`: list the contents of a tree object
- get the SHA, find the object in .git/objects, and read the compressed blob
- decompress it, and read the contents
- for SHA1, convert it from 20-char to 40-char hexstring

# 5. Write a tree object
- iterate over the files in the working directory
- for files, create a blob object and record its SHA hash
- for dirs, recursively create a tree and record its SHA hash
- write the tree with all the SHA hashes
